The EsoLang Wiki has an excellent page on Thue, https://esolangs.org/wiki/Thue.

Wikipedia does too https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thue_(programming_language).

A portable Thue IDE and interpreter can be found at https://mvmn.wordpress.com/2009/03/12/thue-in-java/.


# Problems

## 1) Print Heads or Tails randomly.

## 2) Get a number from the user, print it out backwards.

## 3) Check if an input string of parenthesis are matched correctly

## 4) Get two numbers from the user, subtract the first from the second. Assume the second number is larger.

## 5) Write a Bitwise Cyclic Tag* interpreter in Thue

Consult https://esolangs.org/wiki/Bitwise_Cyclic_Tag and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_system
